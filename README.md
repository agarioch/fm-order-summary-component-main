## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### What I learned

* Media queries apply with a lower priority than non-media queries
* Probably easiest to start designing for mobile first and add media queries for larger layouts
* Box shadow attributes:
```css
box-shadow: h-offset v-offset blur spread color inset;
```
* Images can use object: contain, cover, fill, none, scale-down
```css
object-fit: contain;
```

### Continued development

* Continue trying to understand how to reuse more styling
* Understand BEM naming conventions
